#
# Sharded coverage pipeline for FIDESlib.
#
# The monolithic run (run_coverage.sh) executes the whole suite in one process,
# which needs more GPU memory than a single test process holds and, importantly,
# cannot survive environments that kill long-running background jobs (e.g. a
# 60-minute wall-clock limit). This driver instead runs every test case in its
# own short-lived process:
#
#   - Each case starts with a fresh process, so peak memory is per-test and a
#     crash/abort in one case (rc 134/139/...) can't take the others down.
#   - gcov counters accumulate across the clean exits of each case process, so a
#     single gcovr pass at the end yields full-suite metrics.
#   - Progress is tracked in a done-file, so the run is resumable: relaunching
#     the script after it was killed continues from where it left off.
#   - NOTE: tests run as foreground children (no background subprocesses); this
#     sandbox terminates shells that spawn background children mid-flight.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run_coverage_sharded.sh                                     # full suite (minus benchmarks)
#   TEST_FILTER='OpenFHEInterfaceTests*:OpenFHECompatTests*' ./scripts/run_coverage_sharded.sh
#   CASE_FILE=/tmp/batch.txt ./scripts/run_coverage_sharded.sh            # run exactly the listed cases
#   BUILD_DIR=build-coverage-openfhe ./scripts/run_coverage_sharded.sh    # custom build dir
#
# Notes:
#   - Requires the coverage build already configured and built (see
#     scripts/run_coverage.sh); it does not build.
#   - The .gcda counters are NOT cleared: existing counters (e.g. from an
#     earlier run_coverage.sh) are merged with the sharded measurements.
#   - Benchmark and timing suites are skipped (P2PBenchmark, APIbench,
#     LLMTests, Microbench) like in run_coverage.sh's gcovr config scope.
